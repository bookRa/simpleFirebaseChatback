# simpleFirebaseChatback

Just an example of the most simple user auth flow possible. Clone the files to your localhost and try it out. Pretty simple to create
an account. Log in (just realized...I didn't put a log out...I'll do that later lol...but anyway it's simple just do 
firebase.auth().signOut())

90% of the code is just copy and paste. 
Based off the FirebaseUI docs: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/#implementation_paths
